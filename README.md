# C2C Power Quality Monitoring Visualisation

This repository contains a web server and related code for visualising large-scale power quality (PQ) monitoring data captured during the [C2C project](http://www.enwl.co.uk/c2c), led by Electricity North West Limited. The web server is hosted online here: http://c2c.eee.strath.ac.uk/

The data required to run the web server and other files is available here: https://strathcloud.sharefile.eu/share?cmd=d&id=s54bf049e5e142b0a#/view/s54bf049e5e142b0a?_k=jxa57e. After cloning the repository, put these PyTables (.h5) files in the `data` directory.
